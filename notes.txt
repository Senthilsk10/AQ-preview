Ah, I see! You're trying to **embed Mermaid diagram syntax in a Python string**â€”likely inside an HTML template like your KaTeX exampleâ€”and it's not rendering properly when you open the HTML file.

Letâ€™s fix that.

---

### âœ… Minimal Working Mermaid-in-HTML Python Example

Hereâ€™s how you can **embed Mermaid syntax in a raw `<pre class="mermaid">...</pre>` block** inside a Python triple-quoted string:

```python
def generate_mermaid_html(diagram: str) -> str:
    """Generate full HTML with Mermaid diagram support."""
    return f'''<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset='UTF-8'>
  <script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@10/dist/mermaid.min.js'></script>
</head>
<body>
  <pre class="mermaid">
{diagram}
  </pre>
  <script>
    mermaid.initialize({{ startOnLoad: true }});
  </script>
</body>
</html>'''
```

---

### âœ… Sample Call

```python
diagram = """erDiagram
    CAR ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : allows
    PERSON ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : is
"""

html = generate_mermaid_html(diagram)
with open("mermaid_preview.html", "w") as f:
    f.write(html)
```

---

### âœ… Output Notes

1. **Use triple quotes** for the Mermaid string to preserve line breaks.
2. Avoid `\n` or manual escaping inside the Mermaid syntax.
3. The **diagram must not be wrapped inside backticks or code fences** (i.e., don't use ` ```mermaid `).
4. Use `class="mermaid"` on a `<pre>` or `<div>`.

---

### ðŸ›  If it's still not working:

Make sure:

* You're opening the file in a real browser (not inside VS Code's preview tab).
* You don't use KaTeX backticks (`` `...` ``) or Markdown-style code blocks.

### âœ… Optional: Combine with KaTeX

If you want **both KaTeX and Mermaid** in the same page, I can provide a combined HTML generator as well.

Let me know if thatâ€™s what you're building.
